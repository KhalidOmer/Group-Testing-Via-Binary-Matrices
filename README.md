# Binary Group testing
 
Rapid detection of individuals infected of viruses like Covid-19 is vital in controlling the spread of the disease. The traditional approach to testing (detection) is a test per individual, which is expensive, time consuming and requires large medical capacities.  

The idea of group testing is we divide the population into groups. For each group then mix the samples drawn from each individual in the group and test the mixture. If the result of the test comes out negative then the group is free of the virus and if the result comes out positive then at least one individual of the group is infected. 


The goal of group testing research is to minimize the number of tests required to identify infected individuals in a population.  The problem is equivalent to solve a system of linear equations, with the number of equations being less the number of the unknowns.  


Generally, there are two types of group testings, adaptive tests and non-adaptive test. In this work we consider the non-adaptive tests, where the tests are fixed in advance and conducted in parallel.


We present two topics here, first, the construction of efficient test designs. With the perfect design we can reduce the cost decoding, time and storage wise.  The second we review an algorithm that works on retrieving the missing information.  Here we verify that The Hard thresholding algorithms are robust and accurate in the decoding process.  
# What am I? 

I am a collection of code and pdf files divided into two folders, code and thesis. The code folder contains the code we used, thesis folder contains the document we produced.  

# Who worked on me? 

This is the work of Dr. AbdoElnaser (supervisor) and Khalid Omer (student), it is part of the thesis written to fullfil the requirments of master degree in mathematics from Faculty of mathematical sciences and infromatics, univeristy of Khartoum.
