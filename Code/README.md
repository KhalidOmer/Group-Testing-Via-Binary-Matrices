# Introduction
This is a collection of code and writing that I recently worked on with Dr. Abdoelnaseer Dagoot. The work is on the Group Testing problem. The problem is minimize the number of testing required to test a community of Covid 19. 

If consider the system $Ax = y$ with A representing the measurement matrix, x being the individuals infected and y the outcome of the measurment. The problem is recover $x$ from the knowledge of $A$ and $y$.
